# Access-To-Every-Website
This will be very useful to Carlsbad students. This allows access to any website. If you are on a school computer and school Wifi now try this,
1) Be connected to school Wifi
2) Go on any blcked websites
3) Click Log In
4) Enter 
Username : cusdsub
Password: Spring-time
5) Minimize the box
6) Try out some websites
https://www.instagram.com/
https://www.spotify.com/us/
https://www.twitch.tv/
Whenever the computer is turned off or ran out of battery you will need to repeat the process
The password will occasionally change and it will be updated when it is changed.
I cannot use the actual word for unblcked or this page will get blcked
